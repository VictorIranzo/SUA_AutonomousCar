# SUA_AutonomousCar
(Developed during the Software Engineer Master) A command-line application that represents an autonomous car that uses an adaptation loop MAPE-K using the OSGi Java framework.

# Introduction
The vehicle adapts itself to situations using some rules like:
- Change sensors to other similars that implement the same interface when they stop signaling.
- Change to an upper/lower autonomous level when the road or the traffic changes.
- React to the lost of attention of the driver.

# Documentation
The [design](documentation/Dise√±o_VictorIranzo.pdf) and [tests](documentation/Pruebas.pdf) of the application can be checked in spanish language following the links.
